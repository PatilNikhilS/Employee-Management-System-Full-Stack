 The header is created same in both UI with the help of tailwind 
CSS which allows to write minimum code without creating css page
and to make it more aesthetic.

2. Add Employee:
 As the page start after header the next Element is Button which 
used to add the personal data of the employee as such button indicates 
‚ÄúAdd Employee‚Äù on it when it is clicked it will take us to input form 
where we add employee details with respect to given input boxes as

input box which is created using headless UI which allows it to appear
